            Beyond traditional audits, we offer comprehensive consulting services for blockchain projects at any stage of development. Our team provides strategic guidance on security architecture, protocol design, cryptographic implementations, and best practices for building secure decentralized systems.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-500 mb-4">
            Our due diligence services include in-depth analysis of project architecture, algorithm correctness verification, threat modeling, and risk assessment. We evaluate the technical foundations of protocols, identifying potential weaknesses in design before they become code-level vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-500 mb-8">
            Whether you're building a new ZK proof system, designing a novel consensus mechanism, or integrating complex cryptographic primitives, our consultants bring the expertise to validate your approach. We work closely with your team to ensure security is built in from the ground up, not bolted on as an afterthought.
